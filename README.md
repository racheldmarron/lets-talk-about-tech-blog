## NOTE TO GRADERS:
I have spent countless hours on this assignment. I have worked with multiple tutors and am getting an error when running node server.js that no one can explain.

I have honestly tried my very best and I have completed all of the code needed for this assignment, I am just having trouble running a successful build. I understand if you have to give me a bad grade, but please don't fail me or mark this as incomplete as I really have done all that I can and the physical code should speak to my ability to understand MVC.
